Healthcare data management is frequently hindered by fragmentation, poor interoperability, and inconsistent governance, which undermine data accuracy, transparency, and trust. While socio-technical system analysis (STSA) frameworks such as the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) provide rich conceptual models for understanding the interplay of people, technologies, tasks, and environments, they lack machine-readable implementations that can systematically document and share how healthcare data is generated, exchanged, and governed. This gap obscures provenance, limits data flow traceability, and reduces the effectiveness of governance measures.

To address these challenges, this study develops the first FAIR-compliant ontology of healthcare work systems, based on the SEIPS framework and enriched with provenance metadata to capture data flows explicitly. The ontology was engineered using the NeOn methodology and Web Ontology Language (OWL), with integration of W3C PROV-O standards to represent provenance. Data flow mapping techniques—including Data Flow Diagrams, UML Use Cases, and the Data Value Map—were used to ground the ontology design. The approach ensures that healthcare data flows are systematically documented in a machine-readable format, enabling improved accountability, interoperability, and transparency.

The ontology was evaluated using automated FAIRness assessment tools (F-UJI) and validated through expert review with Human Factors and Ergonomics specialists. Results demonstrate enhanced clarity of data documentation, improved traceability of data provenance, and more substantial alignment between socio-technical models and data governance practices. By linking STSA frameworks with data-centric approaches, the SEIPS Ontology provides a reusable semantic foundation for healthcare data management, paving the way for more trustworthy and interoperable healthcare information systems.
