Introduction
The SEIPS Ontology was developed to enhance data transparency in healthcare data by providing a machine-readable representation of the healthcare work systems. Building on the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework, the ontology captures the interactions between people, tasks, technologies, organizations, and environments, while integrating data flow mapping using with provenance metadata.
Socio-technical system analysis (STSA) frameworks, including SEIPS, offer valuable conceptual models but lack a formal machine-readable format for documenting how healthcare data is generated, exchanged, and transformed across systems. This gap limits data traceability, interoperability, and governance. To address this, the SEIPS Ontology applies the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable  (FAIR) data principles to ensure structured, transparent, and reusable documentation of healthcare data flows.
The ontology was engineered using the NeOn methodology and the Web Ontology Language (OWL), with additional alignment to the W3C PROV-O standard for provenance.
The goal of this ontology is to provide a reusable semantic foundation that links STSA  frameworks, such as SEIPS, with data-centric approaches, including Data Flow Diagrams and the Data Value Map. By embedding data flow into STSA, the SEIPS Ontology supports improved accountability, and interoperability in healthcare data use. Future work will extend its application across heterogeneous datasets and evolving regulatory frameworks.
