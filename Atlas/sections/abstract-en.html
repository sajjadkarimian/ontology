<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Atlas ontology provides a modular, ontology-based extension to Socio-Technical Systems Analysis (STSA) by enabling explicit, machine-readable representation of data flows, data usage, and accountability relationships within complex work systems. Atlas addresses a key limitation of existing STSA methods, which typically capture activities and actors but treat data implicitly, limiting transparency and traceability across organisational and technical boundaries.</span>
